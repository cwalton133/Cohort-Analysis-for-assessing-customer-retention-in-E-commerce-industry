## Business Context
Customer retention is one of the most critical success factors in e‑commerce. Acquiring new customers costs significantly more than retaining existing ones. Businesses must therefore understand behavioral patterns, repeat purchase cycles, and churn risk. Cohort analysis enables segmentation of users based on acquisition period to track how engagement evolves over time.

---

## Purpose of the Project
The objective of this project is to analyze transactional customer data to:
- Measure retention rates
- Identify high‑value customer segments
- Detect churn trends
- Evaluate lifetime value patterns
- Provide actionable insights for marketing and product strategy

---

## Dataset Description
- Raw Dataset → [Dataset_ecommerce.csv](data/raw/Dataset_ecommerce.csv)  
- Processed Notebook → [solution.ipynb](data/processed/solution.ipynb)

---

## Methodology (CRISP‑DM)
1. Business Understanding — Define retention goals and KPIs
2. Data Understanding — Explore structure, anomalies, missing values
3. Data Preparation — Clean, transform, engineer features
4. Modeling — Build cohort matrices and retention tables
5. Evaluation — Validate trends and business relevance
6. Deployment — Present dashboards and recommendations

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
Key preprocessing steps:
- Removed cancelled orders
- Converted invoice dates to datetime format
- Created cohort index variables
- Generated first purchase month
- Built retention matrix tables
- Aggregated customer‑level metrics

---

## Key KPIs & Metrics
- Customer Retention Rate
- Monthly Active Customers
- Repeat Purchase Rate
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Churn Rate
- Cohort Survival Rate
